# Polymath Architecture and Discussions

This repo is the home of our bikeshedding^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H discussions. We believe that communication is vital for a project,
and will document as much as we can to enable a shared understanding for all.

Check out:

- [Monorepo](monorepo.md): Discussion of how the [node monorepo](https://github.com/orgs/polymath-ai/repositories) is structured.
- [Glossary](glossary.md): Where we define our language and vocabulary.
- [Format](format.md): The file format that is the heart of the protocol.
- [Principles](principles.md): The principles that underpin our decisions.
- [The Story](polymath.md): The Story of Poly and Math :)
